            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><i>Hello! I'm Iram Khan, a passionate computer science student and a freelance web designer. I have a strong foundation in computer science principles, and my love for technology extends to creating visually appealing and functional websites.
                As a computer science enthusiast, I am dedicated to learning and adapting to new technologies in the ever-evolving field. My journey into web design has allowed me to combine my technical skills with a keen eye for design aesthetics.
    
                I specialize in crafting user-friendly and responsive websites that not only showcase the uniqueness of each project but also provide a seamless experience for visitors. Whether it's a personal blog, a portfolio, or an e-commerce site, I enjoy turning ideas into engaging digital experiences.
        
                When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll find me exploring the latest trends in web development, experimenting with new design tools, and staying inspired by the dynamic world of technology.
        
                I'm excited to collaborate on projects that challenge me to push my creative boundaries and contribute to making the web a more visually compelling and user-friendly space. Let's bring your ideas to life!</i>
